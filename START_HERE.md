## ⚠️ If Something Goes Wrong

### Error: "Cannot find module"
```bash
npm install
```

### Error: "Port 8080 already in use"
The app will automatically try another port. Check the terminal for the actual URL.

### Error: "Missing Supabase environment variables"
**This is OK!** The app will still run. Backend features just won't work until you set up Supabase.
